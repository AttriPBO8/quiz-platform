# Online Quiz Portal

A responsive web app for timed multiple-choice quizzes. Teachers, Workers and Helpers sign in with their District, Block, Role and phone number, take a 30-question quiz, and see their score straight away. Super Admins and Local Admins manage users, questions and quizzes, and track results.

## What it does

**For quiz-takers**
- Sign in with searchable District, Block and Role lists, phone number and password. Everyone starts with a shared starting password and must set their own at first sign-in (and again after an admin resets it).
- My quizzes: Assigned, In progress, Blocked and Completed.
- Honor code, then a rules pop-up (questions, minutes, pass mark).
- 30 questions (10 Easy, 10 Medium, 10 Hard by default), picked at random. A retake avoids questions already seen.
- Question panel on the left (computer) or across the top (phone). Grey = not answered, light green = answered, blue = current. Flags sit top right, ticks middle right.
- Flag questions and filter to flagged ones; the last flagged question shows Return.
- Timer: yellow reminder at 15 minutes left, red blinking box for the last 5, automatic submit at 0.
- Answers save as they are chosen, so a dropped connection or closed tab loses nothing.
- Submit checks for unanswered questions first. Results show score out of 100 and pass or fail.
- Two failed attempts lock the quiz for 24 hours.
- Three color schemes, dark mode, works on phones.

**For admins** (sign in at `/admin/login`)
- Results: one row per person per quiz, with filters, sortable columns, summary counts and CSV download. Click a name for the question-by-question detail of an attempt.
- Certificates: print a Certificate of Completion for one person (Results > View, or from their attempt) or for everyone who passed in the current filters, one A4 page each. Save as PDF from the print window.
- Users: upload a CSV, reset a user to the starting password (they must choose a new one at sign-in), deactivate accounts. Nobody, admins included, can see a user's password.
- Quizzes: create, set question counts, time limit, pass mark and dates, assign by District, Block and Role.
- Question banks (Super Admin): upload JSON, see how often each question is answered correctly, hide a question.
- Admins (Super Admin): add Local Admins and reset their passwords.
- Local Admins only ever see their own users and the quizzes given to them.

## Running it on a Windows laptop

You need to do steps 1 to 4 once. After that, only step 7 is needed each day.

1. **Install Node.js 22 LTS** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). Accept the default options.
2. **Install PostgreSQL 17** from [postgresql.org/download/windows](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/) (the EDB installer).
   - Choose a password for the `postgres` user and write it down.
   - Keep port 5432. Untick Stack Builder at the end.
3. **Install Git** from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and **VS Code** if you don't have them.
4. **Create the database.** From the Start menu open **SQL Shell (psql)**, press Enter four times to accept the defaults, type your PostgreSQL password, then run:
   ```
   CREATE DATABASE quizportal;
   \q
   ```
5. **Get the code.** In VS Code open a terminal (Terminal > New Terminal) and run:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AttriPBO8/quiz-platform.git
   cd quiz-platform
   npm install
   ```
6. **Set up settings and sample data** (replace `YOUR_DB_PASSWORD`):
   ```
   npm run setup -- YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
   npm run db:deploy
   npm run db:seed
   ```
   `setup` prints two test passwords and saves them in the `.env` file.
7. **Start the app:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000. Stop it with Ctrl+C.

### Test accounts (after `npm run db:seed`)

| Who | How to sign in |
| --- | --- |
| Quiz-taker | District 1, Block 1-1, Teacher, phone 9000000001, password = `DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD` in `.env` |
| Super Admin | `/admin/login`, username `superadmin`, password = `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` |
| Local Admin | `localadmin1` to `localadmin5`, same password as the Super Admin |

All 200 sample users are in `data/sample-users.csv`. The sample questions are in `data/sample-questions.json` (100 general knowledge) and `data/sample-questions-math.json` (45 maths). Every user is assigned three sample quizzes: "Topic A - Sample Text" (30 questions), "Mathematics Basics" (15) and "Quick Practice (6 questions)".

## Everyday commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the app for development at http://localhost:3000 |
| `npm test` | Run the quiz rule tests |
| `npm run build` then `npm start` | Run the production version locally |
| `npm run db:studio` | Open a browser view of the database tables |
| `npm run db:migrate` | After editing `prisma/schema.prisma`, create and apply a database change |
| `npm run create-admin -- name "Full Name"` | Add a Super Admin (add `--local` for a Local Admin) |
| `npm run load-test -- 500` | Simulate 500 people answering at once (local only; needs `npm start` running) |

## File formats for uploads

**Users CSV** (Admin > Users). Columns: `district, block, role_type, phone, name, local_admin, password`.
- `role_type` is Teacher, Worker, Helper or Dummy. Dummy accounts are for testing and are left out of reports.
- `phone` is a 10-digit mobile number. The same phone can exist under different District, Block or Role combinations.
- `local_admin` (optional) is the Local Admin's username. `password` (optional) sets a specific password; otherwise the starting password is used.
- Uploading a row that already exists updates the name and Local Admin, and the password only if one is given.

**Questions JSON** (Admin > Question banks):
```json
[
  { "id": "q_001", "text": "What is the capital of India?", "options": ["Mumbai", "New Delhi", "Kolkata", "Chennai"],
    "correctOption": 2, "difficulty": "easy", "category": "General Knowledge" }
]
```
`correctOption` counts from 1 (2 = New Delhi). Older files with a 0-based `correctAnswer` are also accepted. Uploading a question with an existing `id` updates it.

## Changing the certificate

The organization name, place, the two signatories and whether the score is shown are set at the top of `src/lib/certificate.ts`. The signatures are the two files in `public/signatures/`; replace them with scans of the real signatures (a PNG with a transparent background works best) and update the file names in `src/lib/certificate.ts` if they change. The date printed is the day the person first passed the quiz.

## How the code is organised

```

prisma/migrations/       Database changes, applied in order
prisma/seed.ts           Sample data
src/app/                 Pages (folders match web addresses)
  page.tsx               Quiz-taker sign-in

  attempt/               Quiz screen and results

## Security notes

- Correct answers never leave the server; the browser only gets question text and options. Scoring happens on the server.
- Passwords are stored only as bcrypt hashes, which cannot be turned back into the password. No admin screen or export shows them.
- Five wrong passwords lock an account for 15 minutes. Sessions last 8 hours and end on password change or deactivation.
- Every admin page and download checks the admin's role and limits data to their own users.
- During a quiz, copying, right-click and print shortcuts are blocked. Browsers cannot fully block screenshots, so treat this as a deterrent.
- Everyone starts with the same password, so quiz-takers must set their own before they can see or take a quiz. Until a person does, anyone who knows their District, Block, Role, phone and the starting password could sign in first, so share the starting password only with the people taking quizzes.
- Never commit `.env`. It is already listed in `.gitignore`.
